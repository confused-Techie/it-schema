IT Schema is an ontology to describe computer hardware and devices, aimed to describe the general Information Technologies (IT's) environment and managed devices.

A word of **extreme caution** this schema is still in very early development and is subject to change.

This schema is ready to use in different encodings to ensure simplicity and compatibility, including
* [JSON-LD](/schema.jsonld)
* [RDFa](/schema.rdf)
* [Turtle](/schema.ttl)

For easier human consumption of the schema it is also fully available in [HTML](/schema.html).
